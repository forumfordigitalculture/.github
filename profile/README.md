# Forum For Digital Culture at the University of Chicago

**The Forum for Digital Culture is the cross-departmental center for digital arts and humanities at the University of Chicago.**

The Forum’s three pillars are:
- Teaching digital skills and tools via an M.A. degree program, Ph.D. certificate program, B.A. minor, and non-credit tutorials.
- Research support for projects through all stages of computational work, from the initial acquisition of data to its long-term archiving.
- Publication of research data and digital media compositions on the Web plus on-campus outreach via lectures, conferences, and workshops.
